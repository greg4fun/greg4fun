<p>When you want someone to connect to your NAT-ed or Firewalled server and</p>
<p>you run out of ideas ond options or you even dont have</p>
<p>you dont have access to Firewall or VPN server to configure</p>
<p>anything - you can always try to use reverse ssh tunnel.</p>
<p>The only one condition is that you must be able to ssh from your server to public host( the one other guy wants to connect)</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<p>[Server]  &lt;----&gt; [ FIREWALL/NAT SERVER ] &lt;----&gt; [ BOB HOST with public ip 80.80.80.80]</p>
