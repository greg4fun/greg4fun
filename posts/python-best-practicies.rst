Follow the PEP 8
----------------
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides guidelines for writing readable and maintainable code. Following this guide can make your code more consistent and easier to read for other developers.

Read changelog and new features when new version is released
------------------------------------------------------------
It's good to know what was changed in new python releases.For instance very useful f strings which were introduced in 3.6

Use descriptive variable names
------------------------------
Your variable names should be descriptive and reflect the purpose of the variable. This can make your code easier to understand and maintain.
In Python, using descriptive variable names is an important aspect of writing clean and readable code. Descriptive names can make your code more understandable, easier to read, and easier to maintain. Here are some guidelines for using descriptive variable names in your Python code:

1. Use meaningful and descriptive names: Variable names should reflect the purpose and use of the variable in your code. Avoid using single-letter names or generic names like `temp` or `data`. Instead, use names that describe the value or purpose of the variable, such as `num_items` or `customer_name`.

2. Use consistent naming conventions: Use a consistent naming convention throughout your code. This can make your code easier to read and understand. For example, you can use camel case for variable names (`firstName`) or underscores for function and variable names (`first_name`).

3. Avoid using reserved keywords: Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names. This can lead to syntax errors and make your code harder to read. You can find a list of reserved keywords in Python in the official documentation.

4. Use plural names for collections: If a variable represents a collection of values, use a plural name to indicate that it is a collection. For example, use `users` instead of `user` for a list of users.

5. Use descriptive names for function arguments: Use descriptive names for function arguments to make it clear what values the function expects. For example, use `file_path` instead of `path` for a function that takes a file path as an argument.

Here's an example of using descriptive variable names in a Python function:

.. code-block:: python

    def calculate_average(numbers):
        total = sum(numbers)
        count = len(numbers)
        average = total / count
        return average

In this example, we're using descriptive names for the variables in the function. `numbers` represents a collection of numbers, `total` represents the sum of the numbers, `count` represents the number of numbers in the collection, and `average` represents the average of the numbers.

Using descriptive variable names can make your Python code more readable and understandable. By following these guidelines, you can write code that is easier to read, easier to maintain, and less error-prone.

Write modular and reusable code
-------------------------------
Divide your code into small, reusable functions and modules. This can make your code more maintainable and easier to test.
Modular and reusable code is an important aspect of software development, as it allows for efficient and maintainable code. In Python, there are several ways to achieve this.

1. Functions: Functions are a way to encapsulate a set of instructions that can be reused throughout the code. They can take arguments and return values, making them versatile and adaptable to different use cases.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

    result = add_numbers(2, 3)
    print(result)  # output: 5

2. Classes: Classes allow for the creation of objects that can be reused throughout the code. They encapsulate data and functionality, providing a blueprint for creating multiple instances of the same object.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    class Rectangle:
        def __init__(self, width, height):
            self.width = width
            self.height = height

        def area(self):
            return self.width * self.height

    rect1 = Rectangle(2, 3)
    rect2 = Rectangle(4, 5)

    print(rect1.area())  # output: 6
    print(rect2.area())  # output: 20

3. Modules: Modules are files that contain Python code and can be imported into other files. They allow for the reuse of code across multiple projects and can be organized into packages for better organization.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # my_module.py
    def greeting(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

    # main.py
    import my_module

    my_module.greeting("Alice")  # output: Hello, Alice!

4. Libraries: Python has a large number of libraries that can be used to accomplish common tasks, such as data analysis, web development, and machine learning. These libraries often provide modular and reusable code that can be incorporated into your own projects.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Using the NumPy library to perform a vector addition
    import numpy as np

    vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

    result = vector1 + vector2
    print(result)  # output: [5 7 9]

By using functions, classes, modules, and libraries, you can create modular and reusable code in Python that can be easily maintained and adapted to different use cases.

Handle errors and exceptions
----------------------------

Always handle errors and exceptions in your code. This can prevent your code from crashing and provide better error messages for debugging.
Properly handling exceptions is an important part of writing robust and reliable Python code. Here are some tips for handling exceptions in Python:

1. Use try-except blocks: When you have code that can potentially raise an exception, you should wrap it in a try-except block. This allows you to catch the exception and handle it gracefully.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        y = int(input("Enter another number: "))
        result = x / y
        print(result)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("You can't divide by zero!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

2. Be specific with exceptions: Catching a broad exception like `Exception` can hide bugs and make it difficult to understand what went wrong. It's better to catch specific exceptions that are likely to occur in your code.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        f = open("myfile.txt")
        lines = f.readlines()
        f.close()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found!")

3. Use finally blocks: If you need to perform some cleanup code, such as closing a file or releasing a resource, use a finally block. This code will always be executed, whether an exception is raised or not.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        f = open("myfile.txt")
        lines = f.readlines()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found!")
    finally:
        f.close()

4. Raise exceptions when appropriate: If you encounter a situation where the code cannot proceed because of some condition, raise an exception. This makes it clear what went wrong and allows the calling code to handle the error.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def divide(x, y):
        if y == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("You can't divide by zero!")
        return x / y

By following these tips, you can write Python code that handles exceptions properly, making your code more robust and reliable.


Use virtual environments or docker containers
---------------------------------------------

Use virtual environments to isolate your project dependencies. 
This can prevent conflicts between different versions of packages and ensure that your code runs consistently across different environments.
Python virtual environments and Docker are both tools that allow you to manage and isolate dependencies and configurations for your Python projects, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases.

Python virtual environments are used to create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and installed packages, independent of the system's global Python installation. This is useful when you have multiple Python projects with different dependencies, or when you need to test code on different versions of Python.

A virtual environment can be created using the `venv` module or other third-party tools like `virtualenv`. Once created, you can activate the environment to use the isolated Python interpreter and installed packages.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m venv myenv
    $ source myenv/bin/activate
    (myenv) $ pip install requests

Docker, on the other hand, is a tool for creating and running containerized applications. A Docker container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained environment that includes everything needed to run an application, including the operating system, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

Docker containers are useful when you need to ensure that your application runs consistently across different environments, or when you need to deploy your application to different servers or cloud platforms.

To create a Docker container for a Python application, you would typically create a Dockerfile that specifies the dependencies and configurations for your application, and then build and run the container using the Docker CLI.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    #Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    COPY . .
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    

    #bash
    $ docker build -t myapp .
    $ docker run myapp


In summary, Python virtual environments and Docker are both useful tools for managing dependencies and configurations for your Python projects, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases. Virtual environments are useful for managing Python dependencies locally, while Docker is useful for creating portable and consistent environments for your applications.

Document your code
------------------
Document your code using comments, docstrings, and README files. This can make your code more understandable and easier to use for other developers.
Python docstrings and README files are two ways to document your code and provide information to users and other developers about how to use and contribute to your code.

Docstrings are strings that are placed at the beginning of a function, module, or class definition to provide documentation about its purpose, arguments, and behavior. They can be accessed using the `__doc__` attribute and can be formatted using various conventions such as Google, NumPy, and reStructuredText.

Here's an example of a simple docstring using the Google convention:

.. code-block:: bash

    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        """Return a greeting message for the given name.
        Args:
            name: A string representing the name of the person.
        Returns:
            A string representing the greeting message.
        """
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

README files, on the other hand, are documents that provide an overview of your project, its purpose, installation instructions, usage, and other important information. They are typically written in plain text or Markdown format and placed in the root directory of your project.

Here's an example of a simple README file:

.. code-block:: bash

    # My Project

    My Project is a Python package that provides useful tools for data analysis.

    ## Installation

    To install My Project, run the following command:


    pip install myproject

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use My Project:

.. code-block:: python

    import myproject

    data = myproject.load_data('data.csv')
    result = myproject.analyze_data(data)



By using both docstrings and README files, you can provide comprehensive documentation for your code, making it easier for others to understand and use your code, and encourage contributions and collaborations.
Write unit tests
----------------
Write unit tests for your code to ensure that it works as intended. This can catch bugs early and prevent regressions when you make changes to your code.

Use version control
-------------------
Use version control, such as Git, to manage your code and collaborate with other developers. This can make it easier to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Gitflow is a branching model for Git that provides a structured workflow for managing branching and merging in software development projects. It was first introduced by Vincent Driessen in 2010 and has since become a popular model for managing Git repositories.

Gitflow defines a specific branch structure and set of rules for creating, merging, and managing branches. The main branches in Gitflow are:

1. `master` branch: The `master` branch contains the production-ready code, and should only be updated when new features are fully tested and ready to be released.

2. `develop` branch: The `develop` branch is used for integrating new features and bug fixes into the main codebase. All new development should happen on this branch.

In addition to these main branches, Gitflow defines several supporting branches, including:

3. Feature branches: Feature branches are used for developing new features or making changes to the codebase. They are created from the `develop` branch and are merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete.

4. Release branches: Release branches are used for preparing a new release of the code. They are created from the `develop` branch and are merged into both `master` and `develop` when the release is ready.

5. Hotfix branches: Hotfix branches are used for fixing critical bugs in the code. They are created from the `master` branch and are merged back into both `master` and `develop` when the hotfix is complete.

By using Gitflow, development teams can better organize their code, collaborate more effectively, and manage their projects more efficiently. It provides a clear structure for managing branches and releases, and ensures that changes to the codebase are properly tested and integrated before they are released to production.

Avoid magic numbers and strings
-------------------------------

Avoid using magic numbers and strings in your code. Instead, define constants or variables to represent these values. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.
In Python, "magic numbers" and "magic strings" are hard-coded values that appear in your code without any explanation of what they represent. These values are problematic because they can make your code harder to understand, maintain, and modify.

To avoid using magic numbers and strings in your Python code, you can define constants or enums instead. Constants are variables that hold a fixed value, while enums are special classes that allow you to define a set of named values.

Here's an example of using constants instead of magic numbers in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    # Bad: using magic numbers
    def calculate_discount(price):
        if price > 100:
            return price * 0.9
        else:
            return price * 0.95

    # Good: using constants
    DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 100
    DISCOUNT_RATE_HIGH = 0.9
    DISCOUNT_RATE_LOW = 0.95

    def calculate_discount(price):
        if price > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD:
            return price * DISCOUNT_RATE_HIGH
        else:
            return price * DISCOUNT_RATE_LOW

Similarly, you can use enums to define a set of named values, which can make your code more readable and maintainable. Here's an example of using enums in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    from enum import Enum

    # Bad: using magic strings
    def get_status_code(status):
        if status == "success":
            return 200
        elif status == "error":
            return 500
        else:
            return 400

    # Good: using enums
    class StatusCode(Enum):
        SUCCESS = 200
        ERROR = 500
        BAD_REQUEST = 400

    def get_status_code(status):
        if status == StatusCode.SUCCESS.name:
            return StatusCode.SUCCESS.value
        elif status == StatusCode.ERROR.name:
            return StatusCode.ERROR.value
        else:
            return StatusCode.BAD_REQUEST.value

By using constants or enums instead of hard-coded values in your code, you can make it easier to read, understand, and modify, which can ultimately save you time and effort in the long run.

Use list and dict comprehensions
--------------------------------

Use list comprehensions instead of for loops to create lists. This can make your code more concise and readable.
In addition to list comprehensions, Python also supports dict comprehensions, which allow you to create new dictionaries from existing iterables using a similar syntax.

**List Comprehensions**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists from existing iterables. They consist of an iterable, a variable representing each element of the iterable, and an expression to manipulate the variable. Here are some examples of list comprehensions:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a list of squares of the first ten integers
    squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11)]

    # Create a list of only the even numbers from a given list
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

    # Create a list of words longer than three characters from a string
    sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    words = sentence.split()
    long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > 3]

**Dict Comprehensions**

Dict comprehensions work similarly to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a new dictionary. They consist of an iterable, a variable representing each element of the iterable, and expressions to create the keys and values of the new dictionary. Here are some examples of dict comprehensions:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a dictionary of squares of the first ten integers
    squares_dict = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11)}

    # Create a dictionary from two lists
    keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    values = [1, 2, 3]
    dict_from_lists = {keys[i]: values[i] for i in range(len(keys))}

    # Create a dictionary from a list of tuples
    tuple_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
    dict_from_tuples = {key: value for key, value in tuple_list}

List and dict comprehensions are powerful tools that can help you write more expressive and readable code in Python. They can simplify complex operations and make your code more efficient and concise.

Use type annotations
--------------------
Python3 introduced support for type annotations, which can help improve the readability and maintainability of your code. By specifying the expected types of function arguments and return values, you can catch errors earlier in the development process.
Python 3 introduced type annotations, which allow you to declare the expected type of function arguments and return values. Type annotations can help catch errors at compile time, make your code more readable, and improve code completion in development environments.

Type annotations can be added to functions, variables, and class members. Here are some examples of using type annotations in Python 3:

.. code-block:: python

    def add_numbers(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        return x + y

    result = add_numbers(1, 2)  # result is inferred to be int

    # Type annotation for a variable
    name: str = "John"

    # Type annotations for class members
    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -> None:
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

In the above example, `add_numbers` function takes two arguments of type `int` and returns an `int`. The `name` variable is annotated as a `str`, and the `Person` class has `name` and `age` members annotated as `str` and `int` respectively.

Type annotations are not enforced by the Python interpreter at runtime, but they can be checked using external tools like [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/). Mypy is a static type checker that can be used to verify that your code follows the type annotations you've provided.

Here's an example of using mypy to check the type annotations of a file named `example.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    $ mypy example.py


If there are any type errors, mypy will report them and provide suggestions for how to fix them.

Type annotations are a powerful feature that can help make your Python code more robust and easier to maintain.

Use f-strings for string formatting
-----------------------------------

Python3 introduced f-strings, which provide a concise and readable way to format strings. Instead of using string concatenation or the old % operator, use f-strings to embed variables and expressions directly in your strings.
In Python 3.6 and later, f-strings provide a concise and efficient way to format strings. F-strings are an improvement over older methods like %-formatting and str.format(), providing a more readable and less error-prone way to format strings.

F-strings allow you to include Python expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}` to enclose the expressions. The expressions are evaluated at runtime, and their results are inserted into the string. Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    name = "John"
    age = 30

    # Using f-strings to format a string
    message = f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old."
    print(message)  # My name is John and I'm 30 years old.

    # Using f-strings to perform calculations
    result = f"{2 + 2}"
    print(result)  # 4

    # Using f-strings to call functions
    def double(x):
        return x * 2

    result = f"{double(10)}"
    print(result)  # 20

In the above example, `name` and `age` are inserted into the string using f-strings, and expressions like `2 + 2` and `double(10)` are evaluated at runtime and their results are inserted into the string.

F-strings can also be used to format numbers, dates, and other values in a variety of ways. Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # Formatting numbers with f-strings
    number = 1234.5678
    formatted = f"{number:.2f}"
    print(formatted)  # 1234.57

    # Formatting dates with f-strings
    from datetime import datetime
    today = datetime.today()
    formatted = f"{today:%B %d, %Y}"
    print(formatted)  # May 08, 2023

    # Formatting binary data with f-strings
    data = b"\x00\x01\x02\x03"
    formatted = f"{data.hex()}"
    print(formatted)  # 00010203

In summary, f-strings provide a powerful and flexible way to format strings in Python 3. They make it easy to include Python expressions inside string literals, and offer a variety of formatting options for numbers, dates, and other values.

Use context managers
--------------------
Python3 introduced the with statement, which makes it easy to use context managers to manage resources like files, sockets, and database connections. Using context managers can help ensure that resources are properly closed and released, even if an error occurs.
Context managers are a powerful feature in Python 3 that allow you to manage resources like files, network connections, and database connections in a clean and efficient way. Context managers ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the face of errors and exceptions.

The `with` statement is used to create a context manager. When you use the `with` statement, Python will automatically call the `__enter__()` method of the context manager at the beginning of the block, and the `__exit__()` method at the end of the block.

Here's an example of using a context manager to work with a file:

.. code-block:: python

    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        contents = file.read()
        print(contents)

In the above example, the `open()` function returns a context manager that represents the file. The `with` statement creates a new block of code that uses the file. The `file` variable contains a reference to the file, and can be used to read or write data to the file. When the block of code is finished, Python automatically calls the `file.__exit__()` method to close the file.

Context managers can also be created using the `contextlib` module. The `contextlib` module provides a number of helper functions for creating context managers.

Here's an example of using the `contextlib` module to create a context manager:

.. code-block:: python

    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def timer():
        start_time = time.time()
        yield
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

    with timer():
        # Code to be timed goes here
        time.sleep(1)

In the above example, the `@contextmanager` decorator is used to define a function that returns a context manager. The `yield` statement is used to create the context block. In this case, the `timer()` context manager is used to time how long it takes for the code inside the `with` block to execute.

Context managers are a powerful feature in Python 3 that allow you to manage resources in a clean and efficient way. By using context managers, you can ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the face of errors and exceptions.

Use context decorators
----------------------
Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and classes without changing their source code. Decorators are functions that take another function as an argument, and return a new function that wraps the original function.

Here's a simple example of a decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Before function is called")
            func()
            print("After function is called")
        return wrapper

    @my_decorator
    def my_function():
        print("Inside my_function")

    my_function()

In the above example, `my_decorator()` is a decorator function that takes `my_function()` as an argument. `my_decorator()` defines a new function `wrapper()` that adds some extra functionality before and after calling `my_function()`. The `@my_decorator` syntax is used to apply the `my_decorator()` decorator to the `my_function()` function. When `my_function()` is called, it is actually calling the `wrapper()` function that was returned by `my_decorator()`.

Decorators can be used for a variety of purposes, including logging, profiling, memoization, input validation, and more. Decorators can also be chained together to apply multiple decorators to a function or class.

Here's an example of a decorator that logs the time it takes for a function to execute:

.. code-block:: python

    import time

    def time_it(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute")
            return result
        return wrapper

    @time_it
    def my_function():
        # code to be timed goes here
        time.sleep(1)

    my_function()

In the above example, the `time_it()` decorator takes a function as an argument, and returns a new function that times how long it takes for the original function to execute. The `@time_it` syntax is used to apply the `time_it()` decorator to the `my_function()` function. When `my_function()` is called, it will print a message indicating how long it took to execute.

Use pathlib for file and directory operations
---------------------------------------------

Python3 introduced the pathlib module, which provides a more object-oriented and platform-independent way to work with files and directories. Instead of using the old os.path module, use pathlib to make your code more readable and maintainable.
`pathlib` is a module in Python's standard library that provides an object-oriented way of working with file paths and directories. It offers a more intuitive way to handle paths and filenames than using raw string operations, and it works seamlessly across different operating systems.

Here are some examples of using `pathlib` for file and directory operations:

1. Creating a new directory:

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path('my_folder')
    path.mkdir()

This will create a new directory called `my_folder` in the current working directory.

2. Checking if a file exists:

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path('myfile.txt')
    if path.exists():
        print('File exists')

This code checks if a file called `myfile.txt` exists in the current working directory.

3. Listing all files in a directory:

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path('my_folder')
    for file in path.glob('*'):
        print(file.name)

This code lists all files and directories in the `my_folder` directory.

4. Reading the contents of a file:

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path('myfile.txt')
    content = path.read_text()
    print(content)

This code reads the contents of a file called `myfile.txt` into a string variable.

5. Writing to a file:

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path('myfile.txt')
    path.write_text('Hello, world!')

This code writes the string `'Hello, world!'` to a file called `myfile.txt`.

By using `pathlib` instead of raw string operations, you can write more concise and readable code for file and directory operations. Additionally, `pathlib` works seamlessly across different operating systems, making your code more portable and robust.
Use enumerate instead of len()
------------------------------
When you need to iterate over a sequence and also need access to the index of each element, use enumerate instead of range(len()). This can make your code more concise and readable.
In Python, it's often more efficient and readable to use the `enumerate()` function instead of the `len()` function to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of its index. The `enumerate()` function returns an iterator that generates pairs of the form `(index, value)` for each element in the sequence.

Here's an example of using `enumerate()` to iterate over a list:

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

    # Using len() function
    for i in range(len(fruits)):
        print(i, fruits[i])

    # Using enumerate() function
    for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
        print(i, fruit)

In the first loop, we use the `len()` function to get the length of the `fruits` list and then iterate over the indices using `range()`. We then use the indices to access the corresponding values in the list using the indexing operator.

In the second loop, we use the `enumerate()` function to iterate over the `fruits` list directly. The `enumerate()` function returns pairs of `(index, value)` tuples, which we can unpack into separate variables `i` and `fruit`. This way, we can iterate over the list while keeping track of its index without having to use the `len()` function and `range()`.

Using `enumerate()` instead of `len()` can make your code more readable and efficient, especially when you need to access both the index and the value of each element in a sequence.

Use the __name__ variable for module-level code
-----------------------------------------------
When writing code that should only be executed when the module is run directly (and not imported as a library), use the __name__ variable to check if the module is being run as the main program. This can help prevent unintended side effects when the module is imported as a library.

In Python, the `__name__` variable is a special variable that contains the name of the current module. This variable is often used to determine whether a module is being run as the main program or imported as a module into another program.

Here's an example of using the `__name__` variable to write module-level code:

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        # This code will only run if the module is being run as the main program
        print('This is the main program')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

In this example, we define a `main()` function that contains code that we only want to run if the module is being run as the main program. We then use the `__name__` variable to check if the module is being run as the main program. If it is, we call the `main()` function, which runs the module-level code.

When we import this module into another program, the `__name__` variable will contain the name of the module, not `'__main__'`. This means that the `main()` function won't be called, and the module-level code won't be executed.

Using the `__name__` variable to write module-level code makes your code more modular and reusable. You can import the module into other programs without worrying about the module-level code being executed unintentionally.


 
Use the typing module for more complex types
--------------------------------------------
The typing module provides support for more complex types like Union, Tuple, and Any. Using these types can help improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
In Python, the `typing` module provides support for more complex type annotations beyond the built-in types such as `int`, `str`, and `list`. Using the `typing` module, you can annotate variables and function parameters with more complex types such as `Tuple`, `Dict`, `Union`, and `Optional`.

Here's an example of using the `typing` module to annotate a function parameter with a `List` of `int` values:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import List

    def sum_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(numbers)

In this example, we import the `List` type from the `typing` module and use it to annotate the `numbers` parameter of the `sum_numbers()` function. This tells anyone reading the code that the `numbers` parameter is expected to be a list of integers.

You can also use the `typing` module to annotate more complex types such as nested structures and function signatures. Here's an example of using the `Dict` type to annotate a dictionary with string keys and integer values:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Dict

    def get_values(data: Dict[str, int], keys: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        return [data[key] for key in keys]

In this example, we annotate the `data` parameter with a `Dict` type that has string keys and integer values. We also annotate the `keys` parameter with a `List` of strings. The function returns a `List` of integers, which is also annotated using the `typing` module.

Using the `typing` module can make your code more readable and help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. It also makes it easier for others to understand the expected input and output types of your functions.

Write concise and expressive code
---------------------------------
Python3 supports a wide variety of built-in functions and syntax features that can help you write concise and expressive code. Use features like list slicing, list and dictionary comprehension, and the ternary operator to make your code more concise and readable.
Writing concise and expressive code is important for making your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Here are some tips for writing concise and expressive code in Python:

1. Use list and dictionary comprehensions: List and dictionary comprehensions allow you to create new lists or dictionaries in a concise and expressive way. For example, instead of using a for loop to create a list of squares, you can use a list comprehension:

.. code-block:: python

    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]


2. Use lambda functions: Lambda functions are anonymous functions that can be defined in a single line of code. They are useful for creating short, one-time-use functions. For example, instead of defining a separate function to sort a list by the second element of each tuple, you can use a lambda function:

.. code-block:: python

    my_list = [(1, 2), (4, 1), (9, 10), (13, -3)]
    sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: x[1])


3. Use the ternary operator: The ternary operator allows you to write conditional expressions in a concise and expressive way. For example, instead of using an if-else statement to set a variable based on a condition, you can use the ternary operator:

.. code-block:: python

    x = 10
    y = 'even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd'


4. Use context managers: Context managers allow you to manage resources and ensure that they are properly cleaned up after use. They can be used to replace try-finally blocks and other boilerplate code. For example, instead of opening and closing a file using try-finally, you can use a with statement:

.. code-block:: python

    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
        contents = f.read()


5. Use descriptive variable names: Use variable names that clearly describe their purpose. This makes your code more readable and helps others understand what your code does. For example, instead of using single-letter variable names, use descriptive names like `num_of_users` or `customer_orders`.

By following these tips, you can write code that is concise, expressive, and easy to understand.

Use the built-in functions and modules whenever possible
--------------------------------------------------------

This will make your code more portable and easier to maintain.
Python comes with a wide variety of built-in functions and modules that can make your code more efficient and easier to read. Here are some tips for using them effectively:

1. Use built-in functions: Python has many built-in functions that perform common tasks such as sorting, filtering, and mapping. Instead of writing your own functions, try to use these built-in functions whenever possible. For example, instead of writing a custom function to sort a list, you can use the built-in `sorted()` function:

.. code-block:: python

    my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
    sorted_list = sorted(my_list)


2. Use built-in modules: Python also comes with many built-in modules that provide useful functionality for a wide range of tasks. Instead of writing your own code to perform these tasks, try to use these built-in modules whenever possible. For example, instead of writing your own code to parse command-line arguments, you can use the built-in `argparse` module:

.. code-block:: python

    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--verbose', action='store_true', help='print verbose output')
    args = parser.parse_args()


3. Use built-in data types: Python provides many built-in data types such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Instead of defining your own data structures, try to use these built-in data types whenever possible. For example, instead of defining your own class to represent a point in two-dimensional space, you can use a tuple:

.. code-block:: python

    point = (3, 5)


By using built-in functions, modules, and data types whenever possible, you can write code that is more efficient, easier to read, and easier to maintain.

Use functions to group related code together
--------------------------------------------
This will make your code more modular and easier to read.
Using functions to group related code together is a common programming practice and is often referred to as "modular programming". By grouping related code together in functions, you can make your code more organized, easier to read, and easier to maintain.

Here are some tips for using functions effectively in Python:

1. Define functions for each task: Define functions that perform a single task, such as sorting a list or printing a message. This makes your code more organized and easier to understand.

2. Use descriptive function names: Choose function names that describe what the function does, such as `sort_list` or `print_message`. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.

3. Use parameters and return values: Use parameters and return values to make your functions more flexible and reusable. For example, instead of hardcoding a list to be sorted in a function, you can pass the list as a parameter.

4. Group related functions together: Group related functions together in a module or class. This makes it easier to find and use related functions.

Here's an example of how you might use functions to group related code together in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    def sort_list(my_list):
        return sorted(my_list)

    def print_message(msg):
        print(msg)

    def main():
        my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
        sorted_list = sort_list(my_list)
        print_message("Sorted list: {}".format(sorted_list))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

In this example, we define two functions `sort_list` and `print_message` that perform the tasks of sorting a list and printing a message, respectively. We then use these functions in the `main` function, which is the entry point for our program. By using functions to group related code together, we've made our code more organized and easier to read.

Use classes to create reusable objects.
---------------------------------------

This will make your code more organized and easier to maintain.
Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and are used to define objects that encapsulate both data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. By creating classes, you can create reusable objects with consistent behavior and state, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

Here are some tips for using classes effectively in Python:

1. Define classes for each object: Define classes that represent each object in your program, such as `Person` or `Car`. This makes your code more organized and easier to understand.

2. Use descriptive class names: Choose class names that describe the object, such as `Person` or `Car`. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.

3. Use attributes and methods: Use attributes to store the state of the object and methods to define the behavior of the object. For example, a `Person` class might have attributes such as `name`, `age`, and `gender`, and methods such as `greet()` or `say_hello()`.

4. Encapsulate data and behavior: Encapsulate the data and behavior of the object within the class so that other parts of the program cannot access or modify it directly.

5. Use inheritance and polymorphism: Use inheritance to create new classes that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, and polymorphism to define different behaviors for the same method in different classes.

Here's an example of how you might use classes to create reusable objects in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            self.gender = gender

        def greet(self):
            print("Hello, my name is {} and I'm {} years old.".format(self.name, self.age))

    class Employee(Person):
        def __init__(self, name, age, gender, job_title):
            super().__init__(name, age, gender)
            self.job_title = job_title

        def introduce(self):
            print("Hello, my name is {} and I'm a {}.".format(self.name, self.job_title))

    def main():
        person = Person("Alice", 25, "female")
        person.greet()

        employee = Employee("Bob", 30, "male", "software engineer")
        employee.introduce()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

In this example, we define two classes: `Person` and `Employee`. The `Person` class has attributes `name`, `age`, and `gender`, and a method `greet()` that prints a greeting. The `Employee` class inherits from the `Person` class and has an additional attribute `job_title` and a method `introduce()` that prints an introduction. By using classes to create reusable objects with consistent behavior and state, we've made our code more modular and easier to maintain.

Use a debugger to step through your code and find errors.
---------------------------------------------------------

This will help you to debug your code more quickly and easily.
Debugging is an essential part of software development, and Python provides several tools to help you debug your code. One of the most powerful debugging tools in Python is the built-in `pdb` module, which allows you to step through your code line by line and inspect the state of variables and objects at each step.

Here are some tips for using the `pdb` module effectively:

1. Import the `pdb` module: At the beginning of your script or function, import the `pdb` module using `import pdb`.

2. Insert breakpoints: Use the `pdb.set_trace()` function to insert breakpoints in your code where you want to start debugging.

3. Use the debugger commands: Once the debugger is running, you can use a variety of commands to step through your code, inspect variables, and modify the state of your program. Some of the most commonly used commands include:

- `n` (next): Execute the current line and move to the next line.
- `s` (step): Step into a function call.
- `c` (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
- `p` (print): Print the value of a variable.
- `q` (quit): Quit the debugger.

4. Use the `pdb` module with an IDE: Many integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm or VS Code have built-in support for the `pdb` module, allowing you to use the debugger from within the IDE.

Here's an example of how you might use the `pdb` module to debug a simple Python script:

.. code-block:: python

    import pdb

    def factorial(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)

    def main():
        pdb.set_trace()
        result = factorial(5)
        print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


In this example, we've added a call to `pdb.set_trace()` at the beginning of the `main()` function, which will start the debugger when the script is run. Once the debugger is running, you can step through the `factorial()` function using the `n` and `s` commands, inspect variables using the `p` command, and quit the debugger using the `q` command. By using the `pdb` module, you can quickly and easily debug your Python code and identify and fix errors.

**IPDB**
`ipdb` is a third-party Python debugger that is built on top of the built-in `pdb` debugger. It provides an enhanced interactive interface and syntax highlighting.

To use `ipdb`, you need to install it using pip:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install ipdb


Once you have installed `ipdb`, you can add the following line of code to your Python script to set a breakpoint:

.. code-block:: python

    import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()


This will cause the debugger to stop execution at that point and enter into the interactive `ipdb` shell. From there, you can use various commands to inspect variables, step through your code, and modify the state of your program.

Here are some useful `ipdb` commands:

- `n`: Execute the current line and move to the next line
- `s`: Step into a function call
- `c`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint is reached
- `p <expression>`: Print the value of an expression
- `l`: List the current source code
- `h`: Show the help screen

`ipdb` is a powerful debugger that can help you identify and fix errors in your Python code. However, it is important to use it judiciously and not rely on it too heavily, as it can be time-consuming and can slow down the execution of your program.


**PUDB**
`pudb` is a third-party module that provides a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface for debugging Python code. It is similar to the built-in `pdb` module but offers additional features such as a graphical user interface, syntax highlighting, and code introspection.

Here are some tips for using `pudb` to debug your Python code:

1. Install `pudb`: You can install `pudb` using pip: `pip install pudb`.

2. Import and set a breakpoint: Import `pudb` at the beginning of your script or function and set a breakpoint using the `pudb.set_trace()` function.

3. Use the graphical interface: Once the breakpoint is hit, `pudb` will open a graphical interface that allows you to step through your code, inspect variables, and modify the state of your program. You can use the arrow keys to move between lines of code, press `Enter` to execute a line of code, and use the `p` command to print the value of a variable.

4. Use the sidebar: The `pudb` interface also includes a sidebar that displays information about the current line of code, the call stack, and the variables in the current scope. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the sidebar and press `Enter` to expand or collapse sections.

5. Use the command-line interface: If you prefer, you can also use `pudb` in command-line mode by passing the `--cli` argument when you start the debugger. In this mode, `pudb` provides a text-based interface that you can use to step through your code and inspect variables.

Here's an example of how you might use `pudb` to debug a simple Python script:

.. code-block:: python

    import pudb

    def factorial(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)

    def main():
        pudb.set_trace()
        result = factorial(5)
        print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


In this example, we've added a call to `pudb.set_trace()` at the beginning of the `main()` function, which will start the `pudb` debugger when the script is run. Once the debugger is running, you can use the graphical interface or the command-line interface to step through the `factorial()` function, inspect variables, and identify and fix errors in your code.


Here are some popular Python debuggers:
